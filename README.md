# Change theme

This application is designed to showcase the implementation of theme switching functionality within a React application. It employs the utilization of global CSS variables for individual components, alongside tailored class adjustments. The integration of Tailwind CSS further extends the range of colors available for use throughout the application. Notably, the user's preferred theme is persistently stored in local storage, ensuring its retention even after reloading or closing the browser.

Featuring light, dark, cool, and warm modes, the application serves a purely practical purpose, devoid of any UI design intricacies. Its primary objective is to illustrate the functionality and configuration of theme switching. Leveraging the context hook, the application ensures consistent theme status retention across various components, facilitating seamless usability and customization.
